# DigitalXC Group Parser

This repository contains a Python script developed for the DigitalXC automation specialist coding challenge.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Reads an Excel file (from the "Input" sheet)
- Extracts group names from lines like:
- - Handles multiple groups per line
- Counts occurrences of each group
- Outputs results to `group_output.txt`

## 🚀 Files

- `group_counter.py` — the main Python script
- `group_output.txt` — output generated from the provided Excel data

## 🧠 Highlights
